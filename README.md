# Tip-Calculator
Android app developed in Android Studio using Java. 
This app is for calculating and adding a service tip to a bill.

## The app calculates tips of any percentage from a total bill:
This feature allows users to effortlessly determine the gratuity amount based on a percentage of the total bill. Whether it's a standard 15%, 18%, or a personalized percentage, the app provides flexibility to cater to diverse tipping preferences.
By automating the calculation process, users can avoid mental arithmetic and potential errors, ensuring a more accurate and convenient experience when expressing gratitude through tipping.

## Users can calculate a tip for themselves or split between a group of people:
In addition to individual tip calculations, the app enables users to divide the gratuity among a group of people. This proves especially handy in scenarios such as dining out with friends, where the responsibility for the tip is shared.
The functionality to split the tip ensures fairness and transparency, as users can input the number of individuals involved, and the app then allocates the gratuity accordingly. This feature simplifies the often cumbersome process of manual division, making group payments smoother and more equitable.

## Meant to be simple and easy for anyone to use:
The app's user interface is designed with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, ensuring that even individuals with minimal technical proficiency can navigate and utilize its features effortlessly.
Intuitive design elements, clear instructions, and a streamlined process contribute to an overall user-friendly experience. This simplicity is aimed at making the app inclusive, ensuring that anyone, regardless of technological familiarity, can efficiently leverage its capabilities for quick and accurate tip calculations.
